1. **Mom's Place**
_(Mahabang Parang, Sta. Maria, Bulacan)_
- Overall, the place is pretty good (spacious dining area, incandescent lights, clean surroundings). For entertainment, they play movies in the front with their flat TV. (during our visit, it was _Superman Returns_). We already knew this place long before our visit but most of the time, it's parking space is full, causing us to backout. But now, we had our chance and we're all glad taking it.

- Ordered the following:
  - Kare-kare (⭐️⭐️⭐️)
  - Sisig 
  - Sizzling Liempo
  - Ensaladang Talong
  - Inihaw na Liempo
  - Pansit Bihon/Canton (⭐️⭐️⭐️)
